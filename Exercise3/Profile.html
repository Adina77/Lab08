    <h2>
        Short "Biography" to practice formatting of fonts
    </h2>
    Very private people don't want to make websites about themselves.
    <i>EH is a </i>
    <b>VERY </b>
    <i>private person. </i>
    But even private people like to learn HTML, because:<p>
        It is something new.<br>It may come in handy for posting information.<br>Sites like Facebook are stunningly ugly
        and sell your info.<br>You have total control if you build your own site.<br>Control of your own stuff is a good
        thing.
    <p>



        <b>Here is some more HTML formatting practice: </b>
    <p>

        A good way to indicate citations is by using numbered references, and citing them by superscript numbers. So, I
        would refer to my first reference like this.<sup>1</sup>
    <p>

        I rarely need to use a subscript. But one good use is to indicate a number system if the number is not in
        decimal. For example, the decimal number 72 can be written like this in hexadecimal:
    <p>

        48<sub>16</sub>
    <p>

        Here, I am practicing making <tt>fixed-width font. </tt>This is useful for making font stand out without making
        it <b>bold </b> or <i>italic. </i>For example, it is useful when writing code.
    <p>

        Fixed-width font is also used for comparing several sequences of DNA &mdash; or sequences of amino acids in
        proteins &mdash; where you want each position to line up. But in that case it would be best to create an image
        file for a web page. Here is an example of aligning protein sequences:
